I built a Hierarchical Task To Do List for my Software Engineering class at Minerva University. The app allows users to create tasks and subtasks and even sub-sub tasks. The app also allows users to set deadlines for tasks and subtasks, to mark tasks and subtasks as completed, and to delete tasks and subtasks.
