- Agahozo Shalom Youth Village (ASYV) is a top high school and community for youth in Rwanda.
- My main studies included: <i>Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science, and more.</i>
- During my time at ASYV, I was part of many clubs and activities such as: <i>Music Club, Debate Club, Science Clude, Karate Club, and more.</i>
- I was also selected to be part of a special Computer Science class by Carnegie Mellon University called: <a href="[cmu.cs.academy.edu](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/)">CMU CS Academy</a> Where I completed my introduction to Python courses, developed games and other cool projects. I was later selected to be a Teaching Assistant for the program.
