I created a visually appealing version of Google Chrome Runner. The game was built using Pygame and Object-Oriented Programming in Python. The game has a score system and a high score system. The game also has a pause and resume feature. The game is also responsive to the user's keyboard input. The game has a game over screen and a game start screen. The game has a background music and sound effects, game over sound effect and a jump sound effect.
