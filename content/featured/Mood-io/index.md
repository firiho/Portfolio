A movie and music recommendation web app and algorithm based on users' moods. I developed it using public APIs like Spotify and RapidAPI to gain access to a vast library of songs and movies.

Mood-io uses a series of questions and decisions based on them to determine the user's best recommendation for a movie or song. For example, if a user is feeling depressed, they don't want a song with a tempo higher than 100 BPM, and more.
