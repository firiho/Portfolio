## Description & Photos

Minerva provided us with free tickets to the Messi Experience at Bouchard Plaza Tower. The Messi experience is a journey through the life of Leo Messi: his dreams, his beginnings in Rosario, his resilience and the World Cup of his life.. The museum had a collection of Messi's jerseys, trophies, and other memorabilia.

Here are some photos from the day.
