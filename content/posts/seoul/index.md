## Minerva x Sookmyung buddy program

During my stay in Seoul, Minerva partnered with Sookmyung Women's University to provide us with a historical sites exploration day. We visited the Deuk-su-gung Palace, the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History, and prison-turned-museum Seodaemun Prison History Hall.

Here are some photos from the day.
